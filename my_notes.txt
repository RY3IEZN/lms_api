alembic for data migration ot the db
alembic is good but you have to check and be sure

for enums you have to manually create enums in the db
CREATE TYPE contenttype AS ENUM ('lesson', 'quiz', 'assignment');
CREATE TYPE role AS ENUM ('teacher', 'student');

before you do migrations make sure to drop the db and recreate it back
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;
